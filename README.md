## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [y] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [y] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [y] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [y] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [y] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [y] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [y] User loses the game after an incorrect guess


The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [y] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [n] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [n] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [n] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [n] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [n] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [n] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [n] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [n] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [n] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
I didn't use any outside resources. 

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

One of the challenges that I encountered was understanding what some of the different code fragments did. It was really easy to copy and paste code into my program and make small modifications (for example if a button needed to be a different color), especially since I was under a bit of a time crunch and my main goal was to have a minimum viable product that I could submit. However, the reason I was excited about this project is because I want to learn HTML and CSS (and apply my art skills to website design). As such, I reminded myself why I was applying and completing the pre-work and took the time to actually understand what each line of code did and how the different files interacted to create the game. 

Another big challenge that I had with the submission was figuring out how to add everything to GitHub and how to go about using the platform. I’ve always known that GitHub is a good platform to upload files and show your projects, but till now the only time I’d used GitHub was when I stored some of my class projects online. However, creating a repository from scratch and using a README file and adding links and code to that was new to me. To overcome this challenge, I watched a few more videos about GitHub (beyond the ones provided in the pre-work) and tried a few different things with github.com and the desktop app before I started to get a hold of the platform and how everything worked. 


3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

After completing my submission, I was wondering, “how does one go about publishing a website and creating something that could be searched up on Google and used by anyone?” It was a lot of fun to mess around with the different style elements and see how they impacted the website and I would love to fully design a website from scratch and then publish it on the Internet. 

Another question that I had was about scalability. “How do we take a website and code it in such a way that it transfers to a phone or tablet (and is still aesthetic and effective)?” Is it simply a matter of scaling or do other features (such as animations or layouts) change? 

I was also wondering, “how does storage and memory work with a website?” For instance, if we have a website that takes in login information for everyone who visits, where is that information stored? Furthermore, if there is any sensitive user information, how do we go about encrypting it? 


4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would start by working on some of the aesthetic details of the game. For example, maybe adding a light mode and a dark mode for the user to choose from when playing the game. Similarly, I would like to add some tone options so that the user could choose from different sets of tones when playing the game. 

Another feature that I would add is a timer that shows the user how long it takes them to play the game. This could be useful to a user who is trying to create a personal record or compete with friends in the game. 

Another detail that I would add would be the option of images that pop up instead of the colors as this would provide another layer to the memory game and might be easier/more interesting for some users. 

Finally, I’m not sure how one would go about implementing this, but it would be a lot of fun to have users enter a nickname before they start playing and then have a daily or hourly leaderboard where people could try to get the fastest time for finishing the game.
